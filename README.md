# DigIDENT Provider app

This app was built for the [Digi.me Sarajevo Hackathon](https://digi.me/sjjhackathon), and won the award for the best app in the contest.

Purpose is to enable customers to perform a single KYC verification with the provider, and then import
their Verified Identity into the Digi.me platform, making it possible to prove their identity to other 3rd parties.
